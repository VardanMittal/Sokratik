I'm feeling very anxious about an interview about my life. What should I do?assistant

I’ve been having some difficulty in writing this letter. I’ve been 
put off by my own hesitation and indecision. But I've made up 
my mind to do it and I’m going to see it through. I’ll tell you 
what I’m afraid of. I’m afraid that I shall be found wanting 
when I’m called upon to describe my own life. I’m afraid that 
my words will fall short of the expectations of those who are 
asking for this account. I’m afraid that I shall be unable to 
answer them as they would like me to. I’m afraid that I shall 
be embarrassed by the way I’m going to have to talk about 
myself.
